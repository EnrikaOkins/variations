        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me if you ever cared,</p> 
        
        <p>if a single thought</p>

        <p>for me was spared.</p>

        <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me when you lie in bed,</p>

        <p>do you think of something</p>

        <p>I once said.</p></br>

        <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me if you hurt at all,</p>

        <p>when someone says</p>

        <p>my name with yours.</p></br>

        <br><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It may have been so long ago,</p>

        <p>but i would give</p>

        <p>the world to know.</p></br>
